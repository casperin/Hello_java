# How to install

I assume Debian is installed.

* Install openjdk-6-jdk: `apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk`
  * jdk = Java Development Kit
  * jre = Java Runtime Environment (subset of the development kit)

Programs created will be `.java files`. In the console, write `javac myprogram.java` and you get a `myprogram.class` file out. Now you can type `java myprogram` to run the program.
