# How to install

* Install Debian

* Install openjdk-6-jdk
  * jdk = Java Development Kit
  * jre = Java Runtime Environment (subset of the development kit)

 sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk

Programs created will be .java files. In the console, write `javac myprogram.java` and you get a .class file out. Now you can type `java myprogram` to run the program.
